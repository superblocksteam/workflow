# workflow

This repository contains the source code of the agent plugin for the Workflow integration.
This plugin allows users to invoke existing workflows as part of their API steps.

Learn more about the Workflow integration [here](https://docs.superblocks.com/build-workflows/what-is-a-workflow#1c-workflow-steps).

This is a dependency pulled down by the [agent-controller](https://github.com/superblocksteam/agent-controller) and the [agent-worker](https://github.com/superblocksteam/agent-worker).

**Note**: We have yet to release a major version for this library and breaking changes will be pushed to them until we stabilize and cut a v1 release.

You can find more information about the Agent Platform [here](https://github.com/superblocksteam/agent).
